Hi sir this is Jaedon! Just wanted to say a few quick things muna po:
// On my device I am unable to check for errors on W3C, so I relied on the errors it told me in VSC which I doubt has high accuracy.
// This project was difficult for me and also for Dexter mainly because Seb wasn't there, though he did make the video for us.
// Sorry for submitting late sir I was travelling the whole day

That's all sir! Hope you give our group a good score :)
